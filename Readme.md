## Security
If you find a bug / vulnerability please DO NOT open an issue. Write to `security@bitnation.co` PLEASE use [this](security-bitnation.co.key.pub) PGP key to encrypt your report / email.

## Background
[Pangea](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Pangea-mobile) is the mobile interface to our blockchain jurisdiction. While smart contract's are "onchain" (on a blockchain like Ethereum) communication happens offchain.
Since current chat systems like WhatsApp and Telegram are hevaly centralized, we are using a p2p system to send messages between peers so that bitnaiton doesn't become a central point of failure.
We are using [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p) for the p2p network, which is a great project.

## Install

First clone the project. You can run the commands from the `Usage` section.

## Usage
We are using GX as the dependency manager since libp2p (and almost all go projects from [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/)) use it as the dependecny manager.
However, you don't need to pay attention to it, since you just have to use the make file. The following commands are available:
- `make list` (or just `make`) will list all commands from the Makefile.
- `make deps` will fetch tools that you need in order to work with the project.
- `make install` will install all dependencies needed in order to work with the project.
- `make deps_hack` will "hack" your dependencies. GX rewrites your import paths `github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p` e.g. becomes `gx/ipfs/QmNh1kGFFdsPu79KNSaL4NUKUPb4Eiz4KHdMtFY6664RDp/go-libp2p`. You need this in order to work with the package versions specified in the package.json.
- `make deps_hack_revert` will undo `make deps_hack`. We never want to commit the GX import paths.
- `make deps_mobile` will install some tools needed to build panthalassa for mobile. You need to run this before you can build for ios and android.
- `make ios` will build panthalassa for ios and place it in the `build` folder.
- `make android` will build panthalassa for android and place it in the build folder.
- `make test` will format the code and run all tests.
- `make test_coverage` will test the code and open the coverage report.
